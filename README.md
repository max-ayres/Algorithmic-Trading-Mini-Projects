# Algorithmic-Trading-Mini-Projects
Three small algorithmic trading related projects: Equal Weight Stock Portfolio, Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy, and a Quantitative Value Investing Strategy



Equal Weight Stock Portfolio

Uses IEX Cloud API, therefore, you will need to use your own token
Use the exceel spreadsheet 'stocks.csv', or use your own excel spreadsheet in the same format with your own stocks, in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook 'equal weight stock portfolio.ipynb'
It will produce a new excel spreadsheet called 'trades.xlsx' with the required number of stocks with your inputted portfolio value
