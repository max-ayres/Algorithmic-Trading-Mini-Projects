# Quantitative-Trading-Mini-Projects
Three small quantitative trading related projects: Equal Weight Stock Portfolio, Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy, and a Quantitative Value Investing Strategy, with guidance from free code camp



Equal Weight Stock Portfolio

Uses IEX Cloud API, therefore, you will need to use your own token
Use the exceel spreadsheet 'stocks.csv', or use your own excel spreadsheet in the same format with your own stocks, in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook 'equal weight stock portfolio.ipynb'
It will produce a new excel spreadsheet called 'trades.xlsx' with the required number of stocks with your inputted portfolio value



Quantitative Momentum Strategy

Uses IEX Cloud API, therefore, you will need to use your own token
Use the exceel spreadsheet 'stocks.csv', or use your own excel spreadsheet in the same format with your own stocks, in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook 'Quantitative Momentum Strategy.ipynb'
It will produce a new excel spreadsheet called 'momentum_strategy.xlsx' with the required number of stocks with your inputted portfolio value

Code is made up of two parts, the first part is less accurate and the second part is more accurate as it takes into account multiple timeframes



Quantitative Value Strategy

Uses IEX Cloud API, therefore, you will need to use your own token
Use the exceel spreadsheet 'stocks.csv', or use your own excel spreadsheet in the same format with your own stocks, in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook 'Quantitative Value Investing Strategy.ipynb'
